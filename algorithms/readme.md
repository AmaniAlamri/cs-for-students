# Topic Overview: Algorithms
Algorithms features eight lessons that cover basic concepts related to algorithms like Big O notation and recursion as well as specific sorting and search algorithms.

> **Remember**: A lesson consists of at least one myGA module that introduces the concept and at least one in-class exercise that implements it.

We estimate that this topic will take about 13 hours to complete. Here's how that breaks out across myGA and class time:

| Modality | # of Modules | Estimated time |
|---|---|---|
| myGA | 8 | 4 hours |
| In class | 9 | 9 hours |

## Materials Available
Each lesson listed below has its own folder that contains:
* A **student-facing README** that outlines what's covered in the lesson.
* A **student-facing Exercises folder** with instructions, exercise files, and test scripts.
* **Instructor-only materials** in the Solutions and Instructor Guide folder, including solution code and teaching tips.

Each lesson folder also provides additional resources (e.g., reading materials, videos, additional practice opportunities) for you and your students.

> **Note**: The Introduction to Algorithms lesson does not have a folder, as it's just one myGA module. You can check out that module [here](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/780?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=ec2aabc8-9134-4de5-b00e-d07050f6aa1f).

## Lesson Breakdown
There are eight Algorithms lessons, most of which are **Tier 1** ("MUSTs," the most important topics). This is intentional; algorithms are foundational and come up regularly in job interviews. Additionally, topics like Big O or recursion are referenced often in later CS lessons, so they should be taught early on.

Because many topics build on each other, you should plan to teach the lessons in the order outlined below. However, feel free to spend more or less time on a given lesson depending on how it lands with your students.

> **Teaching tip**: We **strongly recommend** that you complete the myGA modules before teaching the concepts so that you know what students are learning!
