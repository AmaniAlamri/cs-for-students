# Computer Science for Software Engineering Immersive

---

## Overview
The Computer Science portion of Software Engineering Immersive will equip students with foundational CS knowledge to make them more well-rounded engineers and prepare them for questions that often arise in job interviews.



## Course Details
The Computer Science portion of SEI is roughly 30 hours of material, spread across the 12 weeks of SEI and delivered in a blended format â€” both live in class and on the myGA platform.

There are three major topics:
* **Algorithms**: Big O notation, recursion, sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, merge, quick, bucket, radix), and search algorithms (linear, binary).
* **Data structures**: Linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, sets, graphs, binary trees, AVL trees, and tries.
* **Design patterns**: Creational, structural, and behavioral.

### Learning Objectives
The high-level learning objectives for the Computer Science content include:
- Solving algorithmic challenges that are commonly presented in technical interviews.
- Analyzing the computational complexity of algorithms and data structures using Big O notation.
- Implementing common data structures encountered in technical interview questions.
